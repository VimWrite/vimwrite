--The Slayer--

	The Slayer exists in a specific point.
	Ice runs through its viens.
	It has no influence on the rest of the world.
	It is a good in all of us.

	"Be weary." Said the Slayer.
	"I may harm you."
	For the Slayer needs to act to acheive its goal.
	Its existance is not enough to serve its purpose.
	It watches its goal with sharp focus.

	It is the hero to save us.
	Helping one another is the key to its power.
	It creates stability in the world.
	But the Slayer's power is elusive.

	We strive to encase ourselves in the stable.
	Our faint embers fighting against the cold void.
