--The Demon--

	The Demon is all around us. 
	Flaming claws, teeth and eyes.
	Its influence exists in dark places of the world.
	It is the root of all evil.

	"Worry not." Said the Demon.
	"I will not harm you."
	For the Demon need not take any action.
	Its mere existance is enough to serve its purpose.
	It watches us and is watched by us.

	There is no hero to save us.
	No safety in numbers.
	No stability in the world.
	No escape from the fire.

	We burn with the fire of chaos.
	Our faint embers fighting against the cold void.
