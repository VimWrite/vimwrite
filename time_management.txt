I'm realizing that I have terrible time management when it comes to
doing things in my personal life. If its related to work, I'll sacrifice
my body but if its cleaning the garage, I'll put it off for as long as I
can.

I realize that a chore might not be the best example since most people don't like doing them. But then work is like a chore too. Its just a really important chore that will render me homeless if I don't do it. 

I made a list of tasks for Nov and Dec and there are many tasks that are
overdue by weeks. Why is that? These are important things that NEED to be
done. Why am I putting them off and writing about it instead? Maybe because
I like writing more than doing things. It takes no effort for me to open
vim and vomit my mind in the session.

Maybe the things I'm putting off are not as important as I think. I've been
putting off one of those tasks for literally 1 year and my life hasn't fallen
apart because of it. But thats probably not it.

It seems so childish to put off doing things. I will say this though:
there is too much crap to deal with these days. Problems with family, 
house, rent, work (or lack thereof), study, friends (or lack thereof),
love (or lack thereof), etcccccc.

I would never complain in real life about any of that but goddamn! Between
a simple life without success and a complicated life with success, I'll 
take the simple life any day of the weeek.

In summary, value your sanity! Be grateful that you have your head above
water. Believe me, these are deep dark waters we're swimming in.
